## 🚀 About Me

I'm a 16-year-old software developer from **Skardu, Pakistan**, currently in **9th grade**. My journey in programming began when I discovered how code can solve real-world problems and bring ideas to life.

I’ve been teaching myself programming through **YouTube tutorials** and **online resources**. My current focus is on **front-end development** with React, while also diving into **full-stack development** using tools like **Appwrite**.

Outside of coding, I dedicate time to my studies and enjoy experimenting with new technologies to sharpen my skills.
